Note that I am using nodemon, if you don't have it installed on your machine, whether run `npm i -g nodemon` or you can also add it in the dependency package `npm i --save-dev nodemon`.

 ### `npm install`

and 

 ### `npm run dev`

 You will finally need to create a `.env` file and add your credentials for mongo atlas with `DB_USER` and `DB_PWD` variables.
