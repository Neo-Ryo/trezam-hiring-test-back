# Welcome on trezam hiring test back end part

node version `node -v` = 12.16.1

### nodemon
Note that I am using nodemon, if you don't have it installed on your machine, whether run `npm i -g nodemon` or you can also add it only in the dependency package project with `npm i --save-dev nodemon`.

### credentials setup
 You will need to create a `.env` file and add your credentials for mongo atlas with `DB_USER` and `DB_PWD` variables assuming you already have an account, otherwise visit [https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas]. 

### Run the API
`npm install` and `npm run dev`
